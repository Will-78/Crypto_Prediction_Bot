# Crypto Trading Bot

* TODO
    * Setup the Reddit API via their library or token
    * setup binance for crytpo watching based off the json of reddit
    * Use JSON from Binance to make a request to turbo 3.5 gpt 
    * (probably) send post back to whatever location

## setup
* Install Libraries 
    * pip install python-binance
    * pip install openai
    * pip install numpy
    * pip install praw

* Set up env keys
    * export OPENAI_KEY="<KEY>"
    * export BINANCE_AI="<KEY>"

## Potential Issues
* Region Availability 
    * Regions requiring a different ts
    * Not all states within the US have acess to this API resource
